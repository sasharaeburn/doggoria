                        <h1>Golden retriever</h1>
                        <p>The golden retriever has a water-repellent coat that is wavy or flat and gold to cream in color. One of
                            the most attractive features of this breed is the feathering on the neck, legs, thighs, underside and
                            tail.
                            The dog's head is strong and broad. The ears are not very large, but they sit high on the head and hang
                            just below the jaw line. The chest is deep, and the body is well balanced. Golden retrievers live about
                            10 to 13 years.</p>
                        <h2>Personality</h2>
                        <p>The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate. Golden retrievers are playful, yet
                            gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other pets and strangers.
                            These dogs are eager to please, which probably explains why they respond so well to obedience training
                            and are such popular service dogs. They also like to work, whether it involves hunting birds or fetching
                            their guardian's slippers..
                            Golden retrievers are not often barkers, and they lack guard instincts, so do not count on them to make
                            good watchdogs. However, some golden retrievers will let you know when strangers are approaching.</p>
                        <h2>Living with</h2>
                        <p>This breed likes to be active. Remember, golden retrievers are bird dogs at heart, so they love a good
                            game of fetch or a swim. If exercise is provided daily, golden retrievers can adapt to any type of home,
                            even if it is a city apartment.
                            Golden retrievers are considered average shedders. Brushing about once weekly will keep the coat looking
                            nice.</p>
                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>In 1999, the golden retriever was the second most popular AKC breed. This ranking is no surprise, because
                            the dog has many qualities that make for a perfect family pet. The golden retriever's roots are in the
                            fields and waterways of Great Britain, however.
                            The golden retriever was bred to be a bird dog, particularly for hunting water fowl, and the breed
                            resulted from crossing a number of other breeds thought to include spaniels, setters, and the
                            Newfoundland (but not the Newfoundland we know today), and perhaps even a bloodhound. The combination
                            created a hardy, strong swimming dog that could withstand cold water, track wounded game and deal with
                            crippled birds.
                            Today, golden retrievers are not only good bird dogs and family pets; they also are popular as service
                            dogs for the blind and disabled, and as search and rescue dogs and contraband detection dogs. Few dogs
                            can claim this breed's versatility.
